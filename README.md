## Usage
This project looks at classifying the iris dataset with the features 'sepal length (cm)', 'sepal width (cm)', 'petal length (cm)', and 'petal width (cm)'

Run the python files prepended with run_, e.g.,
```
python run_kmeans.py
```
To adjust parameters such as plotting, adjust the inputs at the top of the source code.
